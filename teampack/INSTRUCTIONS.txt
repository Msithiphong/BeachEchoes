Hello Team,

Here are the instructions to connect to the shared database.

STEP 1: INSTALL
Open your terminal in this folder and run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

STEP 2: CREATE CONFIG

Create a new file in this folder named exactly: .env

Paste the following configuration block into that file:

--- PASTE THIS INTO YOUR .ENV FILE ---

DB_NAME=sandbox
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASS=mysecretpassword
DB_HOST=[INSERT_HOST_HERE]
DB_PORT=[INSERT_PORT_HERE]

---------------------------------------

STEP 3: RUN
Run the script:
python get_users.py

IMPORTANT TROUBLESHOOTING:
If the script fails to connect, the "tunnel" address may have changed.
Ping me to get the updated DB_HOST and DB_PORT.
